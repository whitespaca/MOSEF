## ADR-001 — Dependency-free M0 validation

- Date: 2026-07-25
- Status: accepted
- Context: the repository has no implementation baseline and Python package
  installation is unavailable in the current interpreter.
- Alternatives: add a JSON Schema package immediately; validate only by manual
  inspection; provide a small standard-library checker and tests.
- Decision: use Python 3.12 standard-library code for the M0 structural contract
  and negative-path tests. Keep the JSON Schema itself standards-oriented so
  later language implementations can use full validators.
- Consequences: M0 is reproducible offline with no dependency download. The
  checker intentionally implements only the repository's required contract, not
  the full JSON Schema specification.
- Rollback condition: replace or supplement the checker when M1 introduces an
  already-justified schema dependency and cross-language validation.

## ADR-002 — Conservative manuscript initialization

- Date: 2026-07-25
- Status: accepted
- Context: no novel theorem or experiment exists yet, and the sandboxed
  preflight could not see a TeX engine.
- Alternatives: postpone the paper; create an aspirational paper with unsupported
  claims; create a minimal claim-linked manuscript and record the compile blocker.
- Decision: initialize a conservative manuscript that states definitions, imported
  baseline results, the open POSF target, and limitations. Do not claim novelty.
- Consequences: source and bibliography integrity are checked structurally. The
  approved escalated environment later exposed MiKTeX, so the PDF also passed
  compilation, warning scanning, and visual inspection without changing the
  conservative claim policy.
- Rollback condition: revise the structure only when verified evidence supports a
  stronger contribution.

## ADR-003 — Primary-source evidence identifiers

- Date: 2026-07-25
- Status: accepted
- Context: claims need stable links to actually inspected sources.
- Alternatives: cite URLs directly from claims; use bibliography keys only; keep a
  separate source ledger with stable IDs.
- Decision: assign `SRC-NNN` identifiers in literature notes and map each imported
  claim to a source ID and BibTeX key.
- Consequences: claims can distinguish inspection evidence from bibliography
  formatting, and sources can be rechecked without changing claim IDs.
- Rollback condition: migrate identifiers only through an explicit mapping if a
  future reference manager becomes authoritative.

## ADR-004 — Three-layer M1 baseline scope

- Date: 2026-07-25
- Status: accepted
- Context: later counterexample searches need clear semantics, overflow-safe
  execution, and at least one independently implemented verifier.
- Alternatives: begin with external big-integer dependencies; use Python alone;
  use a small exact reference plus bounded authoritative and independent layers.
- Decision: Python supplies arbitrary-precision semantics; Rust is authoritative
  for documented `u64` inputs and uses `u128` modular products; C# `BigInteger`
  independently verifies selected canonical operations. All randomness-like rho
  choices are explicit deterministic inputs.
- Consequences: M1 is dependency-free and reproducible with installed toolchains.
  Rust stage-one exponent construction returns method failure if its `u64`
  exponent product overflows. Validation primality uses exact trial division and
  is not claimed polynomial in input length. The current batch-GCD routine is a
  per-item semantic baseline, not a product-tree optimization.
- Rollback condition: introduce arbitrary-precision Rust only when M2/M3 input
  ranges require it and the dependency, license, and differential plan are
  recorded.
